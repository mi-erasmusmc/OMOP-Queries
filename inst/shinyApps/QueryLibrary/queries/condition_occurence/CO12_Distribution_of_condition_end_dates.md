# CO12 : Distribution of condition end dates.

## Description
This query is used to to provide summary statistics for condition occurrence end dates (condition_occurrence_end_date) across all condition occurrence records: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.
