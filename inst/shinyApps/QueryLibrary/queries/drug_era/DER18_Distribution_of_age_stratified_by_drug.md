# DER18: Distribution of age, stratified by drug

## Description
This query is used to provide summary statistics for the age across all drug era records stratified by drug (drug_concept_id): the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. The age value is defined by the earliest exposure. The input to the query is a value (or a comma-separated list of values) of a drug_concept_id. If the input is omitted, age is summarized for all existing drug_concept_id values.

## Query
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT tt.drug_concept_id,
        min(tt.stat_value) over () AS min_value,
        max(tt.stat_value) over () AS max_value,
        avg(tt.stat_value) over () AS avg_value,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(0.25) WITHIN GROUP( ORDER BY tt.stat_value ) over() AS percentile_25,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5)  WITHIN GROUP( ORDER BY tt.stat_value ) over() AS median_value,
        PERCENTILE_DISC(0.75) WITHIN GROUP( ORDER BY tt.stat_value ) over() AS percential_75
        FROM
    (
        SELECT
      extract(year from (min(t.drug_era_start_date) over(partition by t.person_id, t.drug_concept_id) )) - p.year_of_birth as stat_value,
      t.drug_concept_id
      FROM drug_era t, person p
      WHERE t.person_id = p.person_id
       and t.drug_concept_id in (1300978, 1304643, 1549080)
    ) tt
```
