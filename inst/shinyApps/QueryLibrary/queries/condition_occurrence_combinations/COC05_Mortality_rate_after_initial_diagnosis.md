## Query
The following is a sample run of the query. The input parameters are highlighted in  blue  

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT( DISTINCT diagnosed.person_id ) AS all_infarctions , 
  SUM( CASE WHEN death.person_id IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END ) AS death_from_infarction 
FROM -- Initial diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction 
( 
  SELECT DISTINCT 
    person_id, 
    condition_era_start_date 
  FROM /* diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction, ranked by date, 6 month clean period with 1 year follow-up */ 
  ( 
    SELECT 
      condition.person_id, 
      condition.condition_era_start_date , 
      sum(1) OVER(PARTITION BY condition.person_id ORDER BY condition_era_start_date ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) AS ranking
