# DEX10: Other drugs (conmeds) patients exposed to a certain drug take over some time period

## Description
This query is used to establish the medication (conmeds) taken by patients who also are exposed to a certain drug in a given time period. The query returns the number of patients taking the drug at least once. The input to the query is a value (or a comma-separated list of values) of a drug_concept_id and the time period. See  [vocabulary queries](http://vocabqueries.omop.org/drug-queries) for obtaining valid drug_concept_id values.

```sql
SELECT concept_name, COUNT(1) as persons
FROM ( 
--Other drugs people are taking
  SELECT DISTINCT cohort.person_id, drug.drug_concept_id
  FROM ( 
  --person with specific drug in time frame
  SELECT DISTINCT person_id, drug_concept_id, from_date, to_date
  FROM drug_exposure
  JOIN ( 
  --date range 
  SELECT '01-jan-2008' AS from_date , '31-dec-2009' AS to_date ) 
  ON drug_exposure_start_date BETWEEN from_date AND to_date
  WHERE drug_concept_id IN /*bortezomib, Thalidomide 50 mg capsules */  (1336825, 19047763)
  ) cohort
  JOIN drug_exposure drug 
  ON drug.person_id = cohort.person_id
  AND drug.drug_concept_id != cohort.drug_concept_id
  AND drug.drug_exposure_start_date BETWEEN from_date AND to_date
  WHERE drug.drug_concept_id != 0 /* unmapped drug */
  )
JOIN concept ON concept_id = drug_concept_id
GROUP By concept_name ORDER BY persons DESC;
```
