## Query
The following is a sample run of the query. The input parameters are highlighted in  blue  S

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS num_A_users , SUM( bp_also ) AS num_also_using_B 
FROM /* people taking statin and possible taking antihypertensive agent */ 
    ( SELECT statin.person_id, MAX( NVL( bp, 0 ) ) AS bp_also 
        FROM /*people taking statin */ 
            ( SELECT  person_id, drug_exposure_start_date, drug_exposure_end_date 
                FROM drug_exposure statin 
                WHERE drug_concept_id IN /*statins*/ 
                    ( SELECT concept_id 
                        FROM concept 
                        JOIN concept_ancestor ON descendant_concept_id = concept_id 
                        WHERE 
                        ancestor_concept_id = 21502747
                        AND standard_concept = 'S' 
                        AND sysdate BETWEEN valid_start_date AND valid_end_date ) ) statin                            
            LEFT OUTER JOIN /* people taking antihypertensive agent */ 
            ( SELECT  person_id, drug_exposure_start_date, drug_exposure_end_date , 1 AS bp 
                FROM drug_exposure 
                WHERE drug_concept_id IN /*Antihypertensive Therapy Agents */ 
                    ( SELECT concept_id 
                        FROM concept 
                        JOIN concept_ancestor ON descendant_concept_id = concept_id 
                        WHERE 
                        ancestor_concept_id = 21500223 
                        AND standard_concept = 'S' 
                        AND sysdate BETWEEN valid_start_date AND valid_end_date ) ) bp 
    ON bp.person_id = statin.person_id 
    AND bp.drug_exposure_start_date < statin.drug_exposure_end_date 
    AND bp.drug_exposure_end_date > statin.drug_exposure_start_date 
    GROUP BY statin.person_id );
```

## Output


## Output field list

|  Field |  Description |
| --- | --- | 
| concept_name | An unambiguous, meaningful and descriptive name for the concept. |
| person_id | A foreign key identifier to the person for whom the observation period is defined. The demographic details of that person are stored in the person table. |
| ancestor_concept_id | A foreign key to the concept code in the concept table for the higher-level concept that forms the ancestor in the relationship. |
| drug_exposure_start_date | The start date for the current instance of drug utilization. Valid entries include a start date of a prescription, the date a prescription was filled, or the date on which a drug administration procedure was recorded. |
| drug_exposure_end_date | The end date for the current instance of drug utilization. It is not available from all sources. |
