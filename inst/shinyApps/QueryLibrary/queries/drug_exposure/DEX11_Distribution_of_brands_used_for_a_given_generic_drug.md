## Description
| This query provides the brands that are used for a generic drug. The input to the query is a value of a drug_concept_id. See [vocabulary queries](http://vocabqueries.omop.org/drug-queries) for obtaining valid drug_concept_id values.  Note that depending on the mapping available for the source_values in the drug_exposure table, branded drug information might only partially or not be provided. See the Standard Vocabulary Specifications at  [http://omop.org/Vocabularies](http://omop.org/Vocabularies).
