# DEX03: Distribution of age, stratified by drug

## Description
| This query is used to provide summary statistics for the age across all drug exposure records stratified by drug (drug_concept_id): the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. The age value is defined by the earliest exposure. The input to the query is a value (or a comma-separated list of values) of a drug_concept_id. See  [vocabulary queries](http://vocabqueries.omop.org/drug-queries) for obtaining valid drug_concept_id values. If the input is omitted, age is summarized for all existing drug_concept_id values.

## Input

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| drug_concept_id | 40165254, 40165258 | Yes | Crestor 20 and 40 mg tablets |

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query. The input parameters are highlighted in  blue. 

```sql
SELECT 
    concept_name AS drug_name , 
    drug_concept_id , 
    COUNT(*) AS patient_count , 
    MIN ( age ) AS min  , 
    APPROXIMATE PERCENTILE_DISC(0.25) WITHIN GROUP( ORDER BY age ) AS percentile_25  , 
    ROUND ( AVG ( age ), 2 ) AS mean, 
    APPROXIMATE PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY age ) AS median  , 
    APPROXIMATE PERCENTILE_DISC(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY age ) AS percentile_75 , 
    MAX ( age ) AS max , 
    ROUND ( STDDEV ( age ), 1 ) AS stdDev 
FROM /*person, first drug exposure date*/ ( 
        SELECT 
            drug_concept_id , person_id , 
            MIN( extract(year from drug_exposure_start_date )) - year_of_birth as age 
        FROM 
            drug_exposure JOIN full_201706_omop_v5.person USING( person_id ) 
        WHERE drug_concept_id IN /*crestor 20 and 40 mg tablets */ ( 40165254, 40165258 )
        GROUP BY drug_concept_id, person_id , year_of_birth 
    ) 
JOIN concept ON concept_id = drug_concept_id 
WHERE domain_id='Drug' and standard_concept='S'
GROUP BY concept_name, drug_concept_id;
```
