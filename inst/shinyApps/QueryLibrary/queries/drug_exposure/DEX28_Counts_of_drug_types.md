# DEX28: Counts of drug types

## Description
| This query is used to count the drug type concepts (drug_type_concept_id, in CDM V2 drug_exposure_type) across all drug exposure records. The input to the query is a value (or a comma-separated list of values) of a drug_type_concept_id. If the input is omitted, all possible values are summarized.

## Input

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| list of drug_type_concept_id | 38000175, 38000180 | Yes | 

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query. The input parameters are highlighted in  blue 

```sql
SELECT count(1) as exposure_occurrence_count , drug_type_concept_id FROM drug_exposure 
WHERE 
drug_concept_id in (select distinct drug_concept_id from drug_era)
AND drug_type_concept_id in (38000175, 38000180) 
GROUP BY drug_type_concept_id ;
```

## Output

## Output field list

|  Field |  Description |
| --- | --- | 
| drug_type_concept_id | A foreign key to the predefined concept identifier in the vocabulary reflecting the type of drug exposure recorded. It indicates how the drug exposure was represented in the source data: as medication history, filled prescriptions, etc. |
| exposure_occurrence_count | The number of individual drug exposure occurrences used to construct the drug era. |


## Sample output record

|  Field |  Description |
| --- | --- | 
| drug_type_concept_id |   |
| exposure_occurrence_count |   |
