## Output


## Output field list

|  Field |  Description |
| --- | --- | 
| concept_name | An unambiguous, meaningful and descriptive name for the concept. |
| drug_concept_id | A foreign key that refers to a standard concept identifier in the vocabulary for the drug concept. |
| concept_class | The category or class of the concept along both the hierarchical tree as well as different domains within a vocabulary. Examples are "Clinical Drug", "Ingredient", "Clinical Finding" etc. |
| treatment_length |   |
| person_id | A foreign key to the concept code in the concept table for the higher-level concept that forms the ancestor in the relationship. |
| drug_era_start_date | The start date for the drug era constructed from the individual instances of drug exposures. It is the start date of the very first chronologically recorded instance of utilization of a drug. |
| drug_exposure_start_date | The start date for the current instance of drug utilization. Valid entries include a start date of a prescription, the date a prescription was filled, or the date on which a drug administration procedure was recorded. |
| days_supply | The number of days of supply of the medication as recorded in the original prescription or dispensing record. |
| drug_era_end_date | The end date for the drug era constructed from the individual instance of drug exposures. It is the end date of the final continuously recorded instance of utilization of a drug. |
| ingredient_concept_id |   |
| ancestor_concept_id | A foreign key to the concept code in the concept table for the higher-level concept that forms the ancestor in the relationship. |
