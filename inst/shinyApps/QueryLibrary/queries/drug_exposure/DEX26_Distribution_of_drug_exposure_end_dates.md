# DEX26: Distribution of drug exposure end dates

## Description
| This query is used to to provide summary statistics for drug exposure end dates (drug_exposure_end_date) across all drug exposure records: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.

## Input <None>

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query. 

```sql
SELECT            
    min(tt.end_date) AS min_date , 
    max(tt.end_date) AS max_date , 
    avg(tt.end_date_num) + tt.min_date AS avg_date , 
    (round(stdDev(tt.end_date_num)) ) AS stdDev_days , 
    tt.min_date + (APPROXIMATE PERCENTILE_DISC(0.25) WITHIN GROUP( ORDER BY tt.end_date_num ) ) AS percentile_25_date , 
    tt.min_date + (APPROXIMATE PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY tt.end_date_num ) ) AS median_date , 
    tt.min_date + (APPROXIMATE PERCENTILE_DISC(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY tt.end_date_num ) ) AS percentile_75_date 
    FROM 
        ( SELECT
            (t.drug_exposure_end_date - MIN(t.drug_exposure_end_date) OVER()) AS end_date_num, 
            t.drug_exposure_end_date AS end_date, 
            MIN(t.drug_exposure_end_date) OVER() min_date 
         FROM drug_exposure t ) tt 
GROUP BY tt.min_date ;
```
