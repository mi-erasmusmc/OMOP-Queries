# DEX31: Distribution of drug exposure records per person

## Description
| This query is used to provide summary statistics for the number of drug exposure records (drug_exposure_id) for all persons: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. There is no input required for this query.

## Input <None>
## Query
The following is a sample run of the query. 

```sql
SELECT 
    min(tt.stat_value) AS min_value , 
    max(tt.stat_value) AS max_value , 
    avg(tt.stat_value) AS avg_value , 
    (round(stdDev(tt.stat_value)) ) AS stdDev_value , 
    APPROXIMATE PERCENTILE_DISC(0.25) WITHIN GROUP( ORDER BY tt.stat_value ) AS percentile_25 , 
    APPROXIMATE PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY tt.stat_value ) AS median_value , 
    APPROXIMATE PERCENTILE_DISC(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY tt.stat_value ) AS percential_75 
FROM ( 
        SELECT count(1) AS stat_value 
        FROM drug_exposure t 
        group by t.person_id 
    ) tt ; 
```
