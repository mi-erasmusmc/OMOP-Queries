# C06: Translate a given condition to source codes

## Description
This query allows to search all source codes that are mapped to a SNOMED-CT clinical finding concept. It can be used to translate SNOMED-CT to ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, Read or OXMIS codes.

## Input

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  SNOMED-CT Concept ID |  312327 |  Yes | Concept IDs are numeric. If more than one concept code needs to be translated an IN clause or a JOIN can be used. |
|  Source Vocabulary ID |  2 |  Yes | 2 represents ICD9-CM |
|  As of date |  Sysdate |  No | Valid record as of specific date. Current date â€“ sysdate is a default |

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query to list all source codes that map to a SNOMED-CT concept entered as input. The sample parameter substitutions are highlighted in  blue.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  c1.concept_code,
  c1.concept_name,
  c1.vocabulary_id source_vocabulary_id,
  VS.vocabulary_name source_vocabulary_description,
  C1.domain_id,
  C2.concept_id target_concept_id,
  C2.concept_name target_Concept_Name,
  C2.concept_code target_Concept_Code,
  C2.concept_class_id target_Concept_Class,
  C2.vocabulary_id target_Concept_Vocab_ID,
  VT.vocabulary_name target_Concept_Vocab_Name
FROM
  concept_relationship cr,
  concept c1,
  concept c2,
  vocabulary VS,
  vocabulary VT
WHERE
  cr.concept_id_1 = c1.concept_id AND
  cr.relationship_id = 'Maps to' AND
  cr.concept_id_2 = c2.concept_id AND
  c1.vocabulary_id = VS.vocabulary_id AND
  c1.domain_id = 'Condition' AND
  c2.vocabulary_id = VT.vocabulary_id AND
  c1.concept_id =
312327                                            
  AND c1.vocabulary_id =
'SNOMED'                                          
AND
sysdate                                           
BETWEEN c2.valid_start_date AND c2.valid_end_date;
```
