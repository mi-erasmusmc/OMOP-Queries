# C09: Find all SNOMED-CT condition concepts that can be caused by a given pathogen or causative agent

## Description
This query accepts a SNOMED-CT pathogen ID as input and returns all conditions caused by the pathogen or disease causing agent identified using queries  [C07](http://vocabqueries.omop.org/condition-queries/c7) or  [C08](http://vocabqueries.omop.org/condition-queries/c8).

## Input

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  SNOMED-CT Concept ID |  4248851 |  Yes | Concept Identifier for 'Treponema pallidum' |
|  As of date |  Sysdate |  No | Valid record as of specific date. Current date â€“ sysdate is a default |

## Query
