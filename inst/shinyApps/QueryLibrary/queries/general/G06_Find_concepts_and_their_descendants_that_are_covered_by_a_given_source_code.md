# G06: Find concepts and their descendants that are covered by a given source code

## Description
This query returns all concepts that are direct maps and the descendants of these directly mapped concepts. This is useful if the target standard vocabulary is organized in a tall hierarchy, while the source vocabulary organization is flat.

Additional constraints can be added at the end of the query if only a specific target domain or target vocabulary is desired. For example, if only SNOMED-CT as the standard vocabulary for conditions needs be returned, the target vocabulary can be set to 1.

In the query only FDB indications and contraindications are returned, but not NDF-RT indications or contraindications. That is because no direct mapping between ICD-9-CM and NDF-RT exists. In order to query for drug indications please see queries D12 through D18.

## Query
```sql
WITH dm AS ( -- collect direct maps
SELECT  c1.concept_code as source_code,
        c1.vocabulary_id,
        c1.domain_id,
        c2.concept_id        as target_concept_id,

        c2.concept_class_id     as target_concept_class,
        c2.vocabulary_id     as target_concept_vocab_id,
        'Direct map'        as target_Type
FROM    concept_relationship cr
                JOIN concept c1 ON cr.concept_id_1 = c1.concept_id
                JOIN concept c2 ON cr.concept_id_2 = c2.concept_id
WHERE   cr.relationship_id = 'Maps to'

AND     c1.vocabulary_id = 'ICD9CM'
AND     sysdate BETWEEN cr.valid_start_date AND cr.valid_end_date )

        dm.vocabulary_id,
        dm.domain_id,

    'Descendant of direct map' as target_Type
FROM concept_ancestor ca -- collect descendants which includes ancestor itself
JOIN dm ON ca.ancestor_concept_id = dm.target_concept_id
JOIN concept dc ON ca.descendant_concept_id = dc.concept_id
WHERE dc.standard_concept = 'S';
