# G08: Find ancestors for a given concept

## Description
For a concept identifier entered as the input parameter, this query lists all ancestors in the hierarchy of the domain. Ancestors are concepts that have a relationship to the given concept and is defined as hierarchical in the relationship table, and any secondary, tertiary etc. concepts going up in the hierarchy. The resulting output provides the ancestor concept details and the minimum and maximum level of separation.

## Query
```sql
SELECT C.concept_id as ancestor_concept_id, C.concept_name as ancestor_concept_name, C.concept_code as ancestor_concept_code, C.concept_class_id as ancestor_concept_class_id, C.vocabulary_id, VA.vocabulary_name, A.min_levels_of_separation, A.max_levels_of_separation
FROM concept_ancestor A, concept C, vocabulary VA
WHERE A.ancestor_concept_id = C.concept_id
AND C.vocabulary_id = VA.vocabulary_id
AND A.ancestor_concept_id<>A.descendant_concept_id
AND A.descendant_concept_id = 192671
AND sysdate BETWEEN valid_start_date
AND valid_end_date
ORDER BY 5,7;
```

## Input

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Concept ID |  192671 |  Yes | GI - Gastrointestinal hemorrhage |
|  As of date |  Sysdate |  No | Valid record as of specific date. Current date â€“ sysdate is a default |

## Output

|  Field |  Description |
| --- | --- |
|  Ancestor_Concept_ID |  Unique identifier of the concept related to the ancestor concept |
|  Ancestor_Concept_Name |  Name of the concept related to the ancestor concept |
|  Ancestor_Concept_Code |  Concept code of concept related to the ancestor concept |
|  Ancestor_Concept_>Class |  Concept Class of concept related to the ancestor concept |
|  Vocabulary_ID |  ID of the vocabulary the ancestor concept is derived from |
|  Vocabulary_Name |  Name of the vocabulary the ancestor concept is derived from |
|  Min_Levels_of_Separation |  The length of the shortest path between the concept and the ancestor |
|  Max_Levels_of_Separation |  The length of the longest path between the concept and the ancestor |
