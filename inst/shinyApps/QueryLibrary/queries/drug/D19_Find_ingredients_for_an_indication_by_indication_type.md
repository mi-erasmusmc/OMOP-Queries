# D19: Find ingredients for an indication by indication type

## Description
This query provides all ingredients that are indicated for a certain condition. In addition, it provides the type of indication: FDA-approved, off-label (both based on FDB indication classes) and may treat and may prevent (both based on NDF-RT). Indications have to be provided as FDB indications (vocabulary_id=19) or NDF-RT (vocabulary_id=7).

## Query
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  ingredient.concept_id as ingredient_concept_id,
  ingredient.concept_name as ingredient_concept_name,
  ingredient.concept_code as ingredient_concept_code,
  rn.relationship_name as indication_type,
  indication_relation.relationship_id
FROM
  concept_relationship indication_relation
INNER JOIN
  concept_ancestor a ON a.ancestor_concept_id=indication_relation.concept_id_2
INNER JOIN
  concept ingredient ON ingredient.concept_id=a.descendant_concept_id
INNER JOIN
  relationship rn ON rn.relationship_id = indication_relation.relationship_id
WHERE
  indication_relation.concept_id_1 = 4345991 AND
  ingredient.vocabulary_id = 8 AND
  ingredient.concept_level = 2 AND
  indication_relation.relationship_id in (21,23,155,157,126,127,240,241,281,282) AND
  sysdate BETWEEN ingredient.valid_start_date AND ingredient.valid_end_date;
```
