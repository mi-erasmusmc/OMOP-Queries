# CE04: Conditions, stratified by year, age group and gender

## Description
This query is used to count conditions (condition_concept_id) across all condition era records stratified by year, age group and gender (gender_concept_id). The age groups are calculated as 10 year age bands from the age of a person at the condition era start date. The input to the query is a value (or a comma-separated list of values) of a condition_concept_id , year, age_group (10 year age band) and gender_concept_id. If the input is ommitted, all existing value combinations are summarized..

## Input

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| condition_concept_id |   |   |   |
| gender_concept_id |   |   |   |
| gender_concept_id |   |   |   |
| age_group |   |   |   |
