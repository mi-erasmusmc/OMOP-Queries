## Query
The following is a sample run of the query. The input parameters are highlighted in blue

```sql
WITH SNOMed_diabetes AS ( 
  SELECT DISTINCT descendant_concept_id AS snomed_diabetes_id 
  FROM source_to_concept_map map 
  JOIN concept_ancestor ON ancestor_concept_id = target_concept_id 
  WHERE 
    source_vocabulary_id = 2 /* icd9 */ AND 
    target_vocabulary_id = 1 /* SNOMed */ AND 
    source_code LIKE '250.%' AND 
    sysdate BETWEEN valid_start_date AND valid_end_date
),
tt as ( 
  SELECT 
    diabetic.person_id, 
    count( distinct condition_concept_id ) AS comorbidities 
  FROM /* people with diabetes/onset date */ ( 
    SELECT 
      person_id, 
      MIN( condition_era_start_date ) AS onset_date 
    FROM condition_era 
    JOIN SNOMed_diabetes ON snomed_diabetes_id = condition_concept_id 
    GROUP BY person_id 
  ) diabetic 
  JOIN /* condition after onset date, that are not diabetes */ (

  ) comorb ON 
    comorb.person_id = diabetic.person_id AND 
    comorb.condition_era_start_date > diabetic.onset_date 
  JOIN concept ON concept_id = comorb.condition_concept_id 
  GROUP BY diabetic.person_id 
)
SELECT 
  MIN( comorbidities ) AS min ,
