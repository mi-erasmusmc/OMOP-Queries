# CE12: Distribution of condition era start dates

## Description
This query is used to to provide summary statistics for condition era start dates (condition_era_start_date) across all condition era records: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.

## Input <None>

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query. The input parameters are highlighted in  blue

```sql
SELECT condition_concept_id
     , min(condition_era_start_date)
     , max(condition_era_start_date)
     , to_date( round( avg( to_char( condition_era_start_date, 'J' ))), 'J')
     , round( stdDev( to_number( to_char( condition_era_start_date, 'J' ), 9999999 ))) AS std_dev_days
     , ( SELECT DISTINCT PERCENTILE_DISC(0.25) WITHIN GROUP( ORDER BY condition_era_start_date ) over () 
     FROM condition_era) AS percentile_25
     , ( SELECT DISTINCT PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY condition_era_start_date ) over ()
     FROM condition_era) AS median
     , ( SELECT DISTINCT PERCENTILE_DISC(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY condition_era_start_date ) over ()
     FROM condition_era) AS percentile_75
  FROM condition_era
 WHERE condition_concept_id IN( 254761, 257011, 320128, 432867, 25297 )
  GROUP BY condition_concept_id;
```
