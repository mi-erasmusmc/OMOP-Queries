```sql
WITH SNOMed_diabetes AS ( 
  SELECT DISTINCT 
    descendant_concept_id AS snomed_diabetes_id 
  FROM source_to_concept_map map 
  JOIN concept_ancestor ON ancestor_concept_id = target_concept_id 
  WHERE 
    source_vocabulary_id = 2 /* icd9 */ AND 
    target_vocabulary_id = 1 /* SNOMed */ AND 
    source_code LIKE '250.%' AND 
    sysdate BETWEEN valid_start_date AND valid_end_date
) 
SELECT 
  comorbidity, 
  frequency 
FROM /* top 10 */ ( 
  SELECT 
    comorbidity, 
    count(*) frequency 
  FROM /* commorbidities for patients with diabetes */ ( 
    SELECT DISTINCT 
      diabetic.person_id, 
      concept_name AS comorbidity 
    FROM /* people with diabetes/onset date */ ( 
      SELECT 
        person_id, 
        MIN( condition_era_start_date ) AS onset_date

      GROUP BY person_id 
    ) diabetic 
    JOIN /* condition after onset date, that are not diabetes */ ( 
      SELECT 
        person_id,
