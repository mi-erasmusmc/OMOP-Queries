# OP11: Distribution of observation period end dates

## Description
This query is used to to provide summary statistics for observation period end dates (observation_period_end_date) across all observation period records: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.

## Query
```sql
WITH op AS
( SELECT to_number( to_char( observation_period_end_date, 'J' ), 9999999 )::INT AS end_date
         FROM observation_period)
SELECT to_date( min( end_date ), 'J' ) AS min_end_date
     , to_date( max( end_date ), 'J' ) AS max_end_date
     , to_date( round( avg( end_date ) ), 'J' ) AS avg_end_date
     , round( stdDev( end_date ) ) AS stdDev_end_days
     , to_date( (SELECT DISTINCT PERCENTILE_DISC(0.25) WITHIN GROUP( ORDER BY end_date ) OVER () FROM op), 'J' ) AS percentile_25
     , to_date( (SELECT DISTINCT PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5)  WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY end_date ) OVER () FROM op), 'J' ) AS median
     , to_date( (SELECT DISTINCT PERCENTILE_DISC(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY end_date ) OVER () FROM op), 'J' ) AS percentile_75
  FROM op; /* end_date */
```

## Input

None
