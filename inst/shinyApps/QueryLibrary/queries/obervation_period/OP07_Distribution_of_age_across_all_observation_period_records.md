# OP07:Distribution of age across all observation period records

## Description
Count distribution of age across all observation period records:  the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.

## Query
```sql
WITH t AS (
SELECT DISTINCT
              person_id, EXTRACT( YEAR FROM first_observation_date ) - year_of_birth AS age
         FROM -- person, first observation date
            ( SELECT person_id
                   , min( observation_period_start_date ) AS first_observation_date
                FROM observation_period
               GROUP BY person_id
            )
         JOIN person USING( person_id )
        WHERE year_of_birth IS NOT NULL
) SELECT count(*) AS num_people
     , min( age ) AS min_age
     , max( age ) AS max_age
     , round( avg( age ), 2 ) AS avg_age
     , round( stdDev( age ), 1 ) AS stdDev_age
     , (SELECT DISTINCT PERCENTILE_DISC(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY age ) over () FROM t) AS percentile_25
     , (SELECT DISTINCT PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5)  WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY age ) over () FROM t) AS median_age
     , (SELECT DISTINCT PERCENTILE_DISC(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY age ) over () FROM t) AS percentile_75
        FROM t;
```
