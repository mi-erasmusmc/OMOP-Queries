# OP20: Distribution of observation period length, stratified by gender.

## Description
This query is used to provide summary statistics for the observation period length across all observation period records stratified by gender (gender_concept_id): the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. The length of an is defined as the difference between the start date and the end date. All existing gender_concept_id values are summarized.

## Query
```sql
SELECT
  gender,
  count(*) AS observation_periods_cnt ,
  min( period_length ) AS min_period ,
  max( period_length ) AS max_period ,
  round( avg( period_length ), 2 ) AS avg_period ,
  round( stdDev( period_length ), 1 ) AS stdDev_period ,
  percentile_25,
  median,
  percentile_75
FROM (
  SELECT
    person_id,
    gender,
    period_length,
    PERCENTILE_DISC(0.25) WITHIN GROUP( ORDER BY period_length ) over(partition by gender) AS percentile_25 ,
    PERCENTILE_DISC(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY period_length ) over(partition by gender) AS median ,
    PERCENTILE_DISC(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY period_length ) over(partition by gender) AS percentile_75
  FROM /* person, age */ (
    SELECT
      person_id ,
      concept_name as gender
    FROM (
      SELECT
        person_id ,
        min( observation_period_start_date ) AS first_observation_date
      FROM observation_period
      GROUP BY person_id
    )
    JOIN person USING( person_id )
    JOIN concept ON concept_id = gender_concept_id
    WHERE year_of_birth IS NOT NULL
  )
  JOIN  (
    SELECT
      person_id ,
      observation_period_end_date - observation_period_start_date + 1 AS period_length
    FROM observation_period
  ) USING( person_id )
)
GROUP BY
  gender,
  percentile_25 ,
  median ,
  percentile_75;
